Indian American, lifelong nerd, curious learner, advanced beginner, introverted extrovert, and imperfect perfectionist. Outside of academics, my passions lie in art, dance, and community service. Not only have my personal pursuits brought me joy in life, but they have also strengthened my ability to communicate and understand concepts from different perspectives.
