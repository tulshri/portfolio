  Greetings! Happy to have you visit.
</p>

<p>
 <b> Goal: </b> Optimize existing data processes thru mathematical modeling, ensure effective design of reporting systems, and provide specialized insights to those working on the frontlines of social welfare & government solutions. Hope to carve a space for myself at the intersection of data analytics, software development, and visual storytelling.
</p>

  <b> My Why: </b>
  At the beginning of a chilly winter in 2020, I served as a panelist on a community-wide COVID-19 mitigation webinar alongside an infectious disease specialist, an experienced statistician, the local library director, and one of the chief editors of the city newspaper. Sitting at this virtual table in the midst of professionals, I initially doubted my contributions as a young analyst. But through the success of the event, actual mitigation results from our work, and reassurance from the panelists ---- I realized that at the center of our conversation lay the question that has always driven my academic and professional pursuits: <b> how do we convert distressing numbers on a spreadsheet into persuasive stories that inform and protect vulnerable populations? </b> I was exactly where Iâ€™m supposed to be. With a foundation in mathematics, experience in the K-12 education technology sector, and a passion for community service, I hope to make a difference via efficient data analysis.
